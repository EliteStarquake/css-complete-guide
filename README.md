# CSS Complete Guide
## Course project for [CSS - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/css-the-complete-guide-incl-flexbox-grid-sass/learn/v4/content) by Academind on Udemy

*Course notes will be included here*

### Restart - 24 July 2018

Had to restart by downloading files from the course page because the navbar elements had moved to the right and the CSS Grid work broke the layout, especially the footer. 

### Packages Page
*Lectures 73 - 77*

I hadn't managed the margin between the first box and the navbar. Max did this by using `main` as a selector and adding `padding-top`.
